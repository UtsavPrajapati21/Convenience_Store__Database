Convenience Store Database System
This project is a complete Microsoft Access–based database system designed to manage core operations for a convenience store.
It includes:
•	A fully designed relational schema
•	A working ERD
•	SQL table creation scripts
•	SQL queries (aggregation, joins, updates, deletes)
•	Forms for CRUD operations
•	Reports for business insights
•	Macros for automated actions
•	Screenshots of all UI components
This project demonstrates strong skills in database design, SQL, form/report creation, and relational data management, making it an excellent portfolio piece for Data, IT, and Database-related roles.

How to Use the Project
Option 1 — Open with Microsoft Access
1.	Download the .accdb file
2.	Open in Microsoft Access
3.	Explore forms, reports, tables, and macros
4.	Run queries directly inside Access
Option 2 — Use SQL scripts
1.	Download schema.sql
2.	Run in any MySQL-compatible SQL editor
3.	Populate tables using your own data or by creating insert queries
4.	Run queries from queries_master.sql

Purpose of the Project
This project was created to demonstrate:
•	Relational database design
•	SQL proficiency
