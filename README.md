Perfect — since **you will convert the ERD to PNG**, I will now generate your complete, final, fully polished **README.md** with everything professionally formatted.

📌 Inside the README, I will include a placeholder image reference like:

```markdown
![ERD Diagram](./ERD.png)
```

Once you upload your ERD.png file, it will display correctly.
