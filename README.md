## How to Use This Project

### Option 1 — Open the Access Database

1. Download the `.accdb` file
2. Open in Microsoft Access
3. Use the Navigation Menu to explore forms and reports
4. Run queries using the Access Query Editor

### Option 2 — Run SQL Scripts (MySQL-Compatible Version)

1. Download `schema.sql`
2. Execute in any MySQL-compatible SQL engine
3. Run `queries_master.sql` for analysis & testing

## Purpose of the Project

This project demonstrates:

* Designing relational databases from scratch
* Modeling business logic
* Building forms for CRUD operations
* Creating professional reports
* Applying SQL for analytics
* Automating workflows with macros
